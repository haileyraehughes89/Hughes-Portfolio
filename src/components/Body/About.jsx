            Hello, and welcome! My name is Hailey. I am an MCU enthusiast,
            Swiftie, and below average baker. My love of learning has led me on
            a journey rich in information ranging from my time studying
            Mathematics and Spanish in my undergraduate programs, change systems
            in my graduate courses and most recently, software engineering. 10
            years in education has empowered me with the resilience and
            determination I have needed to produce clear, efficient and scalable
            code. I am well versed in solving complex problems through the
            collaboration of ideas and diverse experience. What has drawn me to
            programming is the vastness in possibility. What has helped me
            persist is the work I have accomplished alongside veteran and
            emerging developers. What I can dream up pales in comparison to what
            the collective can envision and, together, accomplish. So have a
            look around, and if you like what you see, letâ€™s collaborate on a
            project. I look forward to an opportunity to learn with you!
