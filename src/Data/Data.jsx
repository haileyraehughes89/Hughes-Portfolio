    text: "My name is Hailey. I am an MCU enthusiast Swiftie, and below average baker. My love of learning has led me on a journey rich in information ranging from my time studying Mathematics and Spanish in my undergraduate programs, change systems in my graduate courses and most recently, software engineering. 10 years in education has empowered me with the resilience and determination I have needed to produce clear, efficient and scalable code. I am well versed in solving complex problems through the collaboration of ideas and diverse experience. What has drawn me to programming is the vastness in possibility. What has helped me persist is the work I have accomplished alongside veteran and emerging developers. What I can dream up pales in comparison to what the collective can envision and, together, accomplish. So have a look around, and if you like what you see, letâ€™s collaborate on a project. I look forward to an opportunity to learn with you!",
